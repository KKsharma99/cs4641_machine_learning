The folder "Images and Results" is organized into subfolders corresponding to the appropriate section in the paper.
These subfolders contain the visualizations included in the analysis as well as the console log data after running
the algorithms on the set paramaters.

The majority of the code for this project uses the Brown-UMBC Reinforcement Learning and Planning library which can
be found at: https://github.com/jmacglashan/burlap

I also use Juan Jose San Emeterio's public MIT liscenced extension to the BURLAP Library:
https://github.com/juanjose49/omscs-cs7641-machine-learning-assignment-4

The changes that I have made to test different hyperparameters, rewards and other parameters I have included in a
folder named "project". The instructions to run this project are the same as the readme in the link above. The paramaters to tune are specifically mentioned in the analysis document ksharma74-analysis.pdf
